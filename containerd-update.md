containerd is a lightweight and efficient **Container Runtime** responsible for managing the lifecycle of containers, including operations such as pulling images, managing storage and snapshots, creating and running containers, and handling namespaces and networking. 
It is directly used by Kubernetes through the **CRI** and plays a key role in running Pods. 
Keeping containerd up to date is important because newer versions fix bugs and security issues, add features like support for user namespaces, and improve compatibility with Kubernetes. 
Updating containerd can be done via the system's **Package Manager** or by downloading the binary directly from GitHub, and after stopping the service and replacing the files, restarting the service makes it ready for use.

For upgrading containerd in Kubernetes, the following reference can be used:
